### :computer: Everything is configurable in terms of Power Rates, Buffer, Capacity, Tick Rates, Staff max uses and more
Most of the stuffs inside ```/plugins/FNAmplifications``` folder are configurable.
 
Each major category has its own configurable settings. 

You can change them if you think they need balancing or for several reasons
